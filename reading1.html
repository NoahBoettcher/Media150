     <h2>Reflection on Photography and Image Making</h2>
    <p>Photography and other mediums, like drawing (usually pencil or ink), or combinations of photography, illustration, and text, play an important role in how I observe, interpret, and understand the world around me. I enjoy both casually and intentionally photographing, often stopping to photograph what I see if I can visualize a good or pleasant composition, and as previously stated, enjoy switching between my phone and digital camera to depict architecture (though I don’t use the digital camera less for this purpose), and people. I especially enjoy capturing moments or compositions that most people in a given area will not really bother to notice, and enjoy the interplay between history, culture, and modern life in the art I choose to create. Where buildings and settings have become a part of daily life for people and are therefore hardly ever truly examined, I like to come in and capture these and depict them in ways I find satisfying. Architecture carries a lot of meaning in its own appearance as well, and I enjoy observing buildings for signs of their past development, expansions, renovations, and signs of the development around the buildings (for example, marks on the sides of buildings to indicate former placement, expansions, etc.). Architecture carries not only its ornamentation, geometry, and local regional-cultural characteristics, but also its own history of labor, ideology, its own memory, and the cultural priorities of a specific time and place. 
</p>
<p>Photography, drawing, and art more generally has an immense power to it, depending on its purpose and meaning. Most of my planned pieces, mostly in the drawing medium, carry meaning, using an interplay of text, composition, and symbols. I have made use of historical fonts as well, and enjoy embedding themes of history, anti-war sentiments, culture, language, and others to create meaning. Text is an especially interesting thing to include, or rather, add, because photography does not inherently include it, and if text is included in an interesting way, such as as a background or as leading lines to a focal point, it can add much more meaning, interest, and subtlety. Text can also be used more traditionally, where it is simply placed in a picture to convey information. I enjoy using it in both ways, but have tried and will try to make it harmonious with the subject matter and the desired meaning. 
</p>
<p>I have very much enjoyed creating political art in the past, and like to imbue certain pieces with emotional depth that includes historic, cultural, linguistic, and other weight, which I feel creates the motivation in people through emotional attachment. One thing I enjoy doing and look forward to doing is refining pictures through cropping and color correction. The process of selecting what to include and disclude is a process which goes beyond the simple moment a picture is taken, and allows me to interpret reality rather than simply recording it, and emphasize certain objects or people by using compositional rules and lighting/depth.
