    <h2> Creative statement</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Noah. I am currently a senior at Hunter College, majoring in Political Science and Economics. I am very much interested in economic policy, history, politics, art/architecture, culture, and linguistics/languages (as I have grown up with multiple with my German and Japanese parents). I also do very much enjoy photography, and often take pictures with either my phone or my digital camera, and enjoy photographing people, but especially architecture. As a former high school art student, I still carry many of the skills in drawing and composition, and look forward to applying this prior knowledge to the class.  I have also had some experience with digital design, and have used photoshop-adjacent apps to create posters and political art, which I found very enjoyable. 
</p>
<p>In this class, I thus most look forward to using photography and digital design to create and showcase architecture and people. I enjoy combining the two in pieces as well, and like taking pictures of people with architectural backgrounds, or finding settings which display an interesting contrast between historical and modern architecture. I especially love historic architecture, because of its generally rich ornamentation, at times clean lines and geometry, unique regional and cultural features based on the geography/location, and the history that it carries, which I feel is lacking in modern architecture. I also enjoy art and design with political undertones, which most of my past work has carried, because of the messaging and significance it carries, and because of the power of art to inform and motivate people. I think this is one of the most impactful uses of art, and I have in the past enjoyed using various art-related skills to create pieces which I think help convey messages, urgency, and progress.
